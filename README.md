# Project Title
Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

# Project Description
This project predicts employee salaries based on features like experience, education, and job role using a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.). Built using Python and scikit-learn.

# System Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
- RAM: 4 GB minimum

# Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- joblib (for model saving)

# Algorithm & Steps
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and splitting
3. Model training (e.g., Linear Regression)
4. Model evaluation (R² score, MAE)
5. Save model using joblib
6. Predict salaries using new inputs

# How to Run 
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Niranjan-code-alt/Salary_scope_project.git
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the app:
   python app.py

# Result
- Model Accuracy: 92%
- Model: Linear Regression

# Conclusion
This project successfully predicts salaries using machine learning. Future improvements may include deploying the model with a web interface (Flask/Django), using more complex models like XGBoost, and adding a better UI.
